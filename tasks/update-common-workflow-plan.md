# Update Common Workflow Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for creating a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically creates a pull request from the `sample` branch to the `master` branch when there is a push to the `sample` branch.

## Workflow Trigger
- The workflow will be triggered on any push event to the `sample` branch.

## Pull Request Creation
- The workflow will create a pull request targeting the `master` branch.
- The branch name for the pull request will be in the format: `feature/update-common-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` where the timestamp is the date and time when the PR is created.

## Exclusions
- The workflow file itself (`.github/workflows/update-common.yml`) will be excluded from the pull request changes. This means any changes to this file will not be included in the PR.

## Additional Details
- The workflow will use GitHub Actions official APIs and actions to create the pull request.
- The workflow will ensure idempotency and handle errors gracefully.

## Notes
- This document serves as the planning and design document only.
- Implementation and actual PR creation will be done in a separate issue.
